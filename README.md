# College-Dashboard

The College Library Dashboard project is a web-based application developed using PHP that aims to provide a centralized platform for managing and accessing various library resources within a college or educational institution. The dashboard offers a range of features to both the library staff and the students, enhancing the overall library experience.

The College Library Dashboard utilizes PHP as the primary programming language along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development. It employs a MySQL database to store and retrieve information related to books, users, transactions, and other relevant data. The dashboard ensures data security and access control by implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms for both staff and students.
